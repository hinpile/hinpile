- 👋 Hi, I’m @hinpile
- 👀 I’m interested in x86 assembly, emulators, CPU architectures, artificial intelligence, and security.
- 🌱 I’m not really learning any programming languages right now, but I may have to do some web development in the future. Though I wish that such a time will never come. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, go away.
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Discord (Hin Pilē#2824), I'll try to not reply.
